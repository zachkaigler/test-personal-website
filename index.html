    <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
    <p id="body">Hi there! My name is Zach Kaigler. I'm currently studying as a full-time software engineering student
      at Flatiorn School. 
      <br>
      <br>
      A true geek at heart, some of my interests include film, writing and storytelling, 
      playing chess (very poorly), baseball, and hopefully one day being able play board games in person width
      other humans again! 
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm very much looking forward to the next steps in this journey of learning, and I can't
      wait to see what the future holds.
      <br>
      <br>
      For now this text is mostly here just to fill up space so that the page doesn't look so empty, but hopefully one day
      soon I'll have more content to include about tech, web design, and more.
      <br>
      <br>
      Thank you for visiting my site!
